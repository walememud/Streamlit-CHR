Health Indicators Visualization Dashboard
Overview
This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize various health indicators for the United States and its territories. The data for these charts has been compiled by the County Health Rankings (CHR) project by the University of Wisconsin's Population Health Institute. The CHR project tracks over 3,000 counties and independent cities across the U.S. since 2010.

Users can generate annotated percentile charts and time series charts for selected counties, states, and health indicators. These visualizations help in analyzing health trends and disparities across regions, enabling users to make data-driven decisions for public health initiatives.

Features

*Interactive Charts: Users can select a specific indicator and year to generate either a Percentile Chart or a Time Series Chart.

*Filter Selections: Filters such as County, State, and Health Indicator can be selected from the sidebar for customized views.

*Save Filters: Users can save their filter settings and reuse them in future sessions for quicker access to previously selected charts.

*Download Charts: Charts can be downloaded as PNG files for further use or sharing.

*Data Source: Data is sourced from the County Health Rankings (CHR) project.
